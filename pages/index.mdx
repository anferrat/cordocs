Welcome to Corpad! Here you can learn how to collect cathodic protection readings with your smartphone using the app.

## What is Corpad?

Corpad Cathodic Protection is a mobile application available for iOS and Android platforms, designed to simplify the process of gathering periodic pipeline corrosion data in the field. This app allows you to record potentials, current, location, and other relevant data manually and by using a Bluetooth multimeter and the device's GPS receiver. Additionally, you can capture site photos using your device's camera or import them from your photo library and assign them to sites.

The application includes features to display test points and rectifiers on a map, as well as the option to share your location with external GIS applications for navigation or location sharing purposes.

Collected data can be exported as .csv or .kml files and a zip-archive for images, or saved in a custom survey file format (.json or .corpad) that can be shared across platforms and devices.

# QR code and NFC labels

Corpad users can create labels - data strings stored inside a QR code or NFC tag, that contain test point or rectifier information. These labels can be read by anyone with Corpad app installed. There are two types of labels:

- **QR codes** - allows users to create a QR code that can be scanned with the camera to obtain survey item information.

- **NFC tags** - allows users to write and read infromtaion to/from NFC tags. Unlike QR codes, the information on the tags can be updated later in the field. This is only supported on devices with a built-in NFC module.

## What is NFC?

Near Field Communication (NFC) is a wireless communication protocol that enables the transfer of data between two electronic devices over a short distance of up to 4 centimeters (1.6 inches).

In Corpad, one of the devices involved in Near Field Communication (NFC) is your phone, while the other device is an NFC tag - a small electronic label available in various forms and shapes. When you bring your phone close to the NFC tag, data can be transferred almost instantly in both directions.

## What can I store on labels?

You can store a full set of item data on either NFC or QR code labels. This includes comments, potentials, currents, wire properties, rectifier serial number or modal and more.

The only limitation is the capacity of the label. For NFC labels check [supported tags](/nfc/supported_tags.mdx) to learn more about capacity of various tags. QR code labels could 

## Where can I get NFC tags?

NFC tags are widley available on any online marketplace in varios shapes and sizes. Check [supported tags](/nfc/supported_tags.mdx) to learn about what type suits your needs.

## Why do I need labels?

The idea behind the labels is to use them to identify test points and rectifiers. Anyone with Corpad app can scan the label and immediately obtain the relevant information about survey item. User can either locate existing record in the survey, or create a new record based on information on the label.

## How does it work?

The information written on the label can be read by other users who have the Corpad app installed on their devices. These users will be able to access and utilize the information stored on the label in various ways:

- **Read the information** - other users can use their devices to read the data stored on the label.

- **Create survey records** - users can create a new test point or rectifier in their survey based on the information stored on the label.

- **Locate survey records** - users can use the information from the tag to locate and access existing records in their survey that correspond to the data stored on the tag.

  NFC is the technology used for contactless payment with your phone, among
  other applications. Almost all modern phones come equipped with an NFC module,
  which enables various functionalities beyond just contactless payments.

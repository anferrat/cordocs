# Map

Corpad enables users to view survey items with coordinates on the map. While the map feature does require internet access, it may also be cached and available offline, depending on available storage and phone settings.

With Corpad, users can easily access test point and rectifier view screens, create new items, search for items on the map by name, and add layers from .kml, .gpx, .kmz and .geojson files.

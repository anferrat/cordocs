# Connecting a multimeter

To connect a multimeter, navigate to 'Settings' -> 'Digital multimeter' and tap on "Search for multimeters". Ensure that Bluetooth is enabled and that you have granted the app permissions to use Bluetooth. You can adjust these permissions in your phone settings.

Ensure that your multimeter is charged and powered on. For Pokit Pro multimeters, you need to press the physical button once to wake it up. DVM 2130 must be turned on and green light should be blinking fast. Then, press 'Continue'.

The multimeter should appear in the list below. Tap on it and wait for 5-10 seconds while it connects to your phone.

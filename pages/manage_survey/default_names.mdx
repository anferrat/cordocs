# Default names

Default names allow users to define a prefix for new items and readings when name was not provided.

When a new item (test point, pipeline, rectifier) or reading is created without a name, a default name is automatically assigned, consisting of the defined prefix and the index of the item in the list.

For instance, if the default prefix for test points is "TP" and there are ten test points in the survey, the newly created test point will be named "TP 11".

You can customize the prefix in 'Settings' -> 'Default names' by selecting the type of item or reading from the list, editing the prefix value in the input field, and then saving the changes.

## Pipeline name as default

The readings "Pipeline test lead" and "Riser" have an additional option for default names, which is "Use pipeline name as default".

If selected, when a test lead or riser is assigned to a specific pipeline, the name of that pipeline will be used to name these readings without an index. If pipelines are not assigned, the default name is used.

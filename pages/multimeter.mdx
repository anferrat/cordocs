## Bluetooth multimeter

Users can link multimeters that support BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) technology in order to gather voltage and current data.

Depending on multimeter model, users can collect AC/DC voltage and AC/DC current readings directly from the survey and autopopulate related fields. In case of capturing ON/OFF potentials, the app supports various modes to determines interruption cycles including time syncronization over GPS or network.

'Measurements' module provides a way to use your phone as a dsiplay for multimeter, allowing to view currently measured parameters and plot readings on graph.

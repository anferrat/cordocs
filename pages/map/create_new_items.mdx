# Creating survey items

Corpad allows to create new test points or rectifiers directly from the map. Simply long press on an empty space on the map where you wish to create a new item. Then, select the desired type from the options that appear.

After selecting the type of item you want to create from the options that appear, you will be directed to a screen where the latitude and longitude fields are automatically pre-filled with the coordinates you selected on the map.

<ImageView>
  <Image src="/images/map/5.3.png" alt="Add" width={300} height={300} />
  <Image src="/images/map/5.4.png" alt="Add" width={300} height={300} />
</ImageView>

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  The top option when selecting a type is "Share coordinate" When you choose
  this option, the selected latitude and longitude will be shared with a
  third-party app of your choice.

# Common errors

Below is a list of the most common errors encountered when using NFC labels, along with recommendations on how to resolve them:

### Not enough space

You can learn more about supported NFC tags and their capacity limitations by visiting the [Supported tags](./supported_tags.mdx).

If you encounter an error indicating that the tag you are attempting to write to does not have enough space to accommodate the information you are trying to write, consider using a tag with a larger capacity, such as the NTAG215 or NTAG216, which offer more storage space compared to other options like the NTAG213.

Consider reducing the amount of data you are attempting to write to the NFC tag. You can shorten comments or remove some readings to decrease the overall size of the message.

Additionally, using Latin alphabet letters in comments and location properties can help reduce the size of the message.

### Tag is not formatted

This issue may arise if the NFC tag you're attempting to use has not been properly formatted to support the NDEF (NFC Data Exchange Format) used by Corpad. It's possible that the tag was previously used for other applications with specific formatting, leading to compatibility issues.

To resolve this, you'll need to format the NFC tag to ensure it supports NDEF format, allowing Corpad to read and write data to it successfully. You can use other third party applications such as NFC Tools ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wakdev.wdnfc), [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nfc-tools/id1252962749)) to format your tag.

### NFC is not supported

If you encounter this error message, it indicates that your device either lacks an NFC module or that the module is not accessible for use by installed applications like Corpad.

### NFC module is disabled

If you receive this error message, it indicates that the NFC module on your device is currently disabled. On iOS devices, the NFC module cannot be disabled by users, but on Android devices, it can be turned off to conserve battery life.

To enable the NFC module on your device, follow these steps:

1. Open the Settings app on your Android device.
2. Look for the NFC settings. This can usually be found under the "Connections" or "Wireless & networks" section.
3. Toggle the NFC switch to the "On" position.

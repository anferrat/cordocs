# Supported tags

Corpad utilizes NDEF (NFC Data Exchange Format) to transfer data to and from NFC tags. It is the most common format for storing data on NFC tags and is supported by most phones and tag manufacturers.

## Tag capacity

One of the key characteristics of NFC tags is their capacity, which determines how much information can be stored on the tag.

When writing to the tag with Corpad, the message size in bytes is displayed to give you an idea of how much data can be accommodated.

  <Image

    alt="NFC tag view"
    width={300}
    height={300}
  />
</ImageView>

The message size will depend on several factors, including the number of readings, the length of comments, and other data being stored. Typically, the message size can range between approximately 100 to 1000 bytes, with an average size of around 300 to 400 bytes for a fairly complex test point.

## Recommened tags

We recommend using [NTAG](https://www.nxp.com/products/rfid-nfc/nfc-hf/ntag-for-tags-and-labels/ntag-213-215-216-nfc-forum-type-2-tag-compliant-ic-with-144-504-888-bytes-user-memory:NTAG213_215_216) series tags from NXP as they are reliable, inexpensive, and available in various form factors to suit different needs.

- **NTAG215** - With a capacity of 504 bytes, this is the optimal choice for most use cases.

- **NTAG213** - With a capacity of 144 bytes, this option might not have enough space for more complex test points or rectifiers, but it is the most economical choice available.

- **NTAG216** - Offering a larger capacity of 888 bytes, this tag provides plenty of space to store almost any test point or rectifier data, but it is also more expensive.

Other NFC tags are also supported by Corpad since it utilizes NDEF (NFC Data Exchange Format), which is the default standard for writing and reading information to and from NFC tags. Therefore, any NFC tag that adheres to the NDEF standard should work seamlessly with Corpad.

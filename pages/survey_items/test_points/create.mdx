## Test point properties

Each test point has following properties:

- **Status** - there are three available statuses: 'Pass', 'Alert', and 'Problem'. Only one status can be assigned at the time and the user decides what status should be assigned. There are no automatic assignments based on any criteria. When no status selected, 'Unchecked' status applied.

- **Name** - the name of the test point. If left blank, a default name with an index will be automatically assigned. See [Default names](/../../manage_survey/default_names.mdx) for more details.

- **Test point type** - a type for your test point. Available types include 'Test Station', 'Junction Box', 'Piping', 'Field note', and 'Measurement'. This type is used for presentational purposes and affects the icon displayed on the map for this test point and describes what readings user should expect to see in this test point.

- **Latitude/Longitude** - the GPS coordinates of the test point in decimal format. You can press the arrow button next to the field to capture your current coordinates using the phone's GPS receiver.

- **Location** - text field that describes the location of the test point.

- **Comments** - any additional notes related to the test point.

- **Images** - the users can attach an existing image to the test point or capture a new photo with your camera. This feature is available only for users with premium subscription.

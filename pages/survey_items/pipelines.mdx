# Pipelines

A Pipeline (or pipe segment) is an item that groups together a set of 'Test points' based on arbitrary parameters (e.g., location, protection from a single rectifier, license number).

Pipelines have their own properties, such as pipe material and flowing substance.

## Creating pipelines

To create a new pipeline, navigate to the main screen and select the "Add" tab, followed by "Pipeline". Complete the necessary properties and proceed by clicking "Save".

A pipeline has the following properties:

- **Name** - the name of the pipeline. If left blank, a default name with an index will be automatically assigned. See [Default names](/../../manage_survey/default_names.mdx) for more details.

- **License #** - the pipeline's license number as granted by regulatory agencies; leave this field empty if no license is applicable.

- **Coating** - property indicates whether the pipe surface is bare or coated.

- **Material** - the material constituting the pipe.

- **Pipe size** - the Nominal Pipe Size (NPS).

- **Product** - indicates the substance or product conveyed through the pipeline.

- **Comments** - any additional notes related to the pipeline.

# Rectifiers

Rectifiers represent physical rectifiers with properties including GPS coordinates, model, serial number, and output settings (e.g., TAP value).

A Rectifier can encompass either a single circuit or multiple circuits, each with current and voltage properties. It can also include an anode bed, where current output for individual anodes can be recorded.

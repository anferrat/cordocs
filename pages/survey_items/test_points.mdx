# Test points

Test points are the basic survey items, that are used to capture 

Test Points consist of a list of readings, such as pipeline test leads, anode test leads, and shunts. At the same time, test point readings can have their own properties, such as current, potentials, shunt properties etc. This structure allows for the creation of complex test point compositions commonly encountered in the field.

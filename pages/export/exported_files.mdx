## Exported files

Exported files are conveniently stored in one location for easy access. To access them, navigate to Settings-> Exported Files. From here, you can manage your exported files efficiently.

Upon selecting a file, you'll have various options available. Tap on "..." and select "Share" to share file with third-party applications. For Android users, you also have the options to "Open In" and "Save to Downloads". If you wish to remove a file, simply press the "Delete" button.

<ImageView>
  <Image src="/images/export/6.9.png" alt="Add" width={300} height={300} />
</ImageView>

For .csv files, you can preview them directly within the app. Just tap on the file name, and you'll be directed to a preview screen. Please note that larger files may not be fully displayed, and editing information within the file is not supported.

To clear all exported files at once, you can use the "Delete All" button located at the bottom of the screen. Please be aware that this action is irreversible.

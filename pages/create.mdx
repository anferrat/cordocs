# Creating surveys

## Creating a new survey

To initiate data collection, you need to create a new survey. A survey in Corpad is where all your data is stored.

Once a survey is created, the app will only operate within that survey, and other surveys will be inaccessible until you close the current one.

To create a new survey, simply tap the "+" sign or select the "Create new survey" button.
Additionally, you can create a new survey using data from a .csv file (see [Import](/import.mdx)).
Type the desired name for the survey and press “Create” button.

<ImageView>
  <Image src="/images/create/2.1.png" alt="Hello" width={300} height={300} />
  <Image src="/images/create/2.2.png" alt="Hello" width={300} height={300} />
</ImageView>

## Survey Types

There are two types of surveys in Corpad: Device-based and Cloud-based. Both types function similarly in terms of data collection but differ in how the data is stored.

- Device-based surveys are stored directly on your phone, providing a fully offline option that remains accessible as long as you have your phone with you.

- Cloud-based surveys enable you to store your survey data on Google Drive. When creating or accessing a cloud-based survey, an internet connection is required. This option is recommended for areas with reliable internet coverage.

After creation, these surveys will be listed on the main screen under the tabs labeled 'Device' and 'Cloud'.

## Template

If you already have a survey stored on your device, you can create a new survey using an existing survey as a template.

This action generates a copy of the existing survey while clearing all non-permanent reading values (such as potentials, currents, voltage drops, etc.) and resetting the statuses of all items to "Unchecked".

For premium users, there's also an option to copy images from the template survey to the new survey.

  <Image src="/images/create/2.3.png" alt="Hello" width={300} height={300} />
</ImageView>
